<h2 style="text-align: center;">Description</h2>

<p>Let's implement the simplest search engine possible. It searches for a specific word in a line containing various words.</p>

<p>The first line contains several words separated by a space. The words are numbered in order, with the first word having index 1. Suppose that all the words in the first line are unique, so there can be no repetitions.</p>

<p>Write a simple program that reads a single line, and then another line. The program must search in the second line for a word specified in the first line. The program should output the index of the specified word. If the word does not appear in the second line, the program should print <code class="java">"Not Found"</code>. Remember that indexes start from 1!</p>

<p>You should output exactly one line.</p>
