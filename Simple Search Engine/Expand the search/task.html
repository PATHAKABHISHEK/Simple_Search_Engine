<h2 style="text-align: center;">Description</h2>

<p>Write a program that reads text lines from the standard input and processes queries consisting of a single word to search for. The program must output all lines that contain the string from the query.</p>

<p>You may choose what the text in your project represents. For example, each line may describe:</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>a person, represented by a first name, last name, and an optional email.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>the address of a building, represented by country, city, state, street, and zip code.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>information about a book represented by ISBN, title, author/authors, publisher, and so on.</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>You can take any of these ideas or use your own, but it is important to work with the same type of dataset throughout all stages of the project. You can use spaces, commas (see CSV), or any other characters as item delimiters.</p>

<p>Here is an example of a line. It contains three items: first name, last name and email of a person.</p>

<pre><code class="language-no-highlight">Elsa Sanders elsa@gmail.com</code></pre>

<p>In this example, all items are separated by spaces.</p>

<p>The search should ignore the case of the letters and all extra spaces.</p>

<p>First, the user should input a number N, which indicates the number of lines with data that will be entered next. Then the user enters N lines of data. After that, the user enters a number M (number of search queries). After each query, the program should print the information found among the data. You can see this search process in the example below.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Example</h2>

<p>In the following example, we use people as an example of the dataset. The lines that start with &gt; represent the user input.</p>
